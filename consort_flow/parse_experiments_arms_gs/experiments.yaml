supporting quotes:
- Specifically, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate Autobiographical Self-Enhancement Training (ASET) -- a novel, cognitive intervention for NSSI focused on reducing self-criticism and enhancing positive self-worth.
- For the present RCT, we tested ASET against another potentially active treatment (expressive writing) and also against a control treatment (journaling).
- Expressive writing, a procedure first developed by Pennebaker and Beall [19] involves writing about stressful or upsetting experiences.
- Finally, we used a journaling (JNL) condition as a comparison control intervention. This involved writing about daily events without any focus on emotional issues. The JNL intervention was developed to control for daily writing (which was inte- gral to both the ASET and the EW conditions).
- After completion of the baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: JNL (N = 46), EW (N = 49), and ASET (N = 49) using randomization software within Qualtrics.

supporting quotes:
- The present study provides an initial direct test of the hypothesis that openness to experience modulates the effects of a pharmacological manipulation of dopamine on measures of divergent thinking. Groups of healthy males received either the dopamine receptor blocker sulpiride or a placebo prior to performing four divergent thinking tasks. Openness to experience was measured beforehand and independently of the pharmacological manipulation.
- The final sample reported here consisted of 193 males (mean age = 25.8, SD = 3.9; n = 95 in the sulpiride group and n = 98 in the placebo group).
- In a placebo-controlled, double-blind between-subjects design, participants orally ingested either 200 mg sulpiride or a placebo. Both substances were delivered in capsules matched for weight and color to assure double-blindness to participants’ experimental conditions.

supporting quotes:
- The aim of this study was to determine whether patients who performed PFMT before and after surgery, regained urinary continence earlier than patients who only performed PFMT after catheter removal.
- Before surgery, patients were randomized into the experimental group, starting PFMT 3 weeks before RP and continuing after surgery, or the control group, starting PFMT after catheter removal. 
- Every patient received individual treatment on an outpatient basis once a week. The experimental group started exercising 3 weeks before RP. They received one session of 30 minutes of guided PFMT per week until surgery. Additionally patients performed a home program of 60 contractions/ day and were instructed on contracting the pelvic floor muscles while coughing and sitting down/ getting up from a chair. The fourth day after surgery, with the urinary catheter in situ, patients were encouraged to restart PFMT.
- The control group started exercising the day of catheter removal
- One hundred eighty patients were included, 91 patients were randomized to the intervention group and 89 patients to the control group.

- Briefly, the closed peer support group included approximately 10 patients and involved 16 sessions of 90 min biweekly over 8 months. Participants decided the topic of each session. Each session had the same structure discussing daily life experiences in pairs as well as group wise.
- The key point was to provide peer-to-peer interaction (3). For that reason, nurses needed to guide the groups with minimal involvement.
- Patients in the experimental condition participated in these groups and received care as usual consisting of medication monitoring, psycho-education, and supportive counseling.
- Patients in the control condition were put on a waiting list expecting to participate in their peer support group 8 months later. In the meantime, they did not follow a prescribed treatment protocol, but received care as usual.

supporting quotes:
- We conducted a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to explore the role of government information intervention on a firm’s management practices and performance. Specifically, we studied whether providing managers with information regarding the benefits of Quality Management practice (QM) can enable government to influence manager perception and adoption of QM, output quality, and firm performance.
- We first randomly assigned the 328 firms into three groups: control (TG0), treatment (TG1), and placebo (TG2). 
- Managers in treatment group TG1 received information/statistics about the benefits of adopting QM, in a 40-minute meeting with an MPI official. Managers in the control group TG0 were not exposed to any information from our experiment, nor did they participate in any such meeting. The placebo group TG2 had a placebo meeting, which also lasted 40 minutes. However, managers in the placebo group did not receive information/statistics about QM benefits.
- The placebo meetings covered topics such as economic policies and matters that are expected to have no effect on QM practice (e.g., changing the workers’ shifts).

supporting quotes:
- Practice guidelines (PGs) are systematically developed statements intended to assist in patient and practitioner decisions. The AGREE II is the revised tool for PG development, reporting, and evaluation, comprised of 23 items, two global rating scores, and a new User’s Manual. In this study, we sought to develop, execute, and evaluate the impact of two internet interventions designed to accelerate the capacity of stakeholders to use the AGREE II.
- Participants were randomized to one of three training conditions. ‘Tutorial’–participants proceeded through the online tutorial with a virtual coach and reviewed a PDF copy of the AGREE II. ‘Tutorial + Practice Exercise’–in addition to the Tutorial, participants also appraised a ‘practice’ PG. For the practice PG appraisal, participants received feedback on how their scores compared to expert norms and formative feedback if scores fell outside the predefined range. ’AGREE II User’s Manual PDF (control condition)’–participants reviewed a PDF copy of the AGREE II only.
- we hypothesized the training platform that included the tutorial plus the practice exercise with feedback would be superior to the User’s Manual alone. For exploratory purposes, we also examined whether dif- ferences existed across the outcome measures between the two e-learning intervention groups.

supporting quotes:
- This study investigated the effect of alcohol on cognition in a randomized placebo-controlled pretest-posttest design. 
- Participants of the alcohol group received Gösser Zwickl® (5.2% alcohol by volume) and participants of the non-alcoholic group received Gösser Naturgold® (< 0.5% alcohol by volume). These two beers were selected because they are very similar in taste and visual appearance (i.e., golden, naturally cloudy).
- The amount of beer was individually adjusted for weight, age and gender (Watson, Watson, & Batt, 1980; Widmark, 1932) targeting at a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03 (in case of alcoholic beer).

    anxiety induction from body odor:
        experiment description: an experiment that tested whether females became more anxious when smelling odors collected from males in an anxiety-inducing setting compared to a neutral setting
        arms:
            anxiety condition:
                arm description: odors collected from males undergoing an anxiety-inducing high rope course exercise
                initial sample:
                    size: <a number>
                    stage: <targeted, randomized, or analyzed>
            neutral condition:
                arm description: odors collected from the same males during a 20 minute ergometer workout in a hospital on a different day
                initial sample:
                    size: <a number>
                    stage: <targeted, randomized, or analyzed>

supporting quotes:
- Thirteen male subjects participated in 2 different sweat donation sessions: chemosignals were collected during participation in a high rope course (anxiety condition) and in an ergometer workout (neutral condition). State and trait anxiety were evaluated in 20 female odor recipients using Spielberger’s state-trait anxiety inventory in a double-blind design.
- During the first session, emotion of anxiety was induced by an exercise during a high rope course. The subjects were advised to climb a 7-m high pole and to stand on that pole without seeing the securing device that was fixed at the subjects’ back
- The control samples were collected during a 20 min ergometer workout in the hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich on a different day.

                    stage: <targeted, randomized, or analyzed>

supporting quotes:
- The aim of this study was to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness in overweight/obese men with vitamin D deficiency.
- This study was a prospective, placebo controlled, double blinded, randomized clinical trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1.
- The enrolled individuals were then randomized, in a double-blind manner, to either receiving vitamin D drops (Cholecalficerol, ACO Hud Nordic AB, Sweden) or placebo drops for six months. The intervention group received 2000 IU cholecalciferol/day (25 drops, 80 IU/drop); the placebo group received the same amount of rapeseed oil.
