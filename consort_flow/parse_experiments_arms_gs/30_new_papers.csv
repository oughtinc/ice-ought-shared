","For the present RCT, we tested ASET against another potentially active treatment (expressive writing) and also against a control treatment (journaling). ","Expressive writing, a procedure first developed by Pennebaker and Beall [19] involves writing about stressful or upsetting experiences. ","Finally, we used a journaling (JNL) condition as a comparison control intervention. This involved writing about daily events without any focus on emotional issues. The JNL intervention was developed to control for daily writing (which was inte- gral to both the ASET and the EW conditions). ","After completion of the baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: JNL (N = 46), EW (N = 49), and ASET (N = 49) using randomization software within Qualtrics.

",All eligible women were stratified by region and ethnicity and randomized into a control or intervention group by an independent researcher of the VU University Medical Center. ,"The women in the control group received the usual care.

","The experiment used a 2x3x2 mixed design with the between participants factor treatment group (analgesia-expectation, control-expectation) and the within factors setting (virtual, augmented, physical) and time (pre-intervention, post-intervention). Participants were assigned to either an analgesia-expectation or control-expectation group using an alternating quasi randomization allocation method, and order of settings was administered in a counterbalanced manner. ","In contrast, participants in the control-expectation condition were informed that the aim of the experiment was to examine pain perception under different visual conditions, hence why they would either view the arm, or view a glove covering the arm.
