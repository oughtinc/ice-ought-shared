TRUE,test,what is the relationship between income and smoking?,"Brunilda Casetta et al., 2016","Introduction
Previous evidence linked low socioeconomic status with higher smoking prevalence. Our objective was to assess the strength of this association in the world population, updating a previous work.


Methods
Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Subgroup analyses included continents, WHO regions, country mortality levels, gender, age, risk of bias, and study publication date. Independent reviewers selected studies, assessed potential bias and extracted data. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SOCINDEX, AFRICAN INDEX MEDICUS, and LILACS, and other sources from 1989 to 2013 reporting direct measurements of income and current cigarette smoking.


Results
We retrieved 13,583 articles and included 93 for meta-analysis. Median smoking prevalence was 17.8% (range 3-70%). Lower income was consistently associated with higher smoking prevalence (odds ratio [OR]: 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-1.56). This association was statistically significant in the subgroup analysis by WHO regions for the Americas (OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.42-1.68), South East Asia (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.10-2.00), Europe (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.29-1.63), and Western Pacific (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.02-1.72), and in studies conducted during 1990s (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.24-1.62) and 2000s (OR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.30-1.64). Likewise, it was noted in low-mortality countries (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.37-1.60) and for both genders. Prevalence was highest in the lowest income levels compared to the middle (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.49-1.92), followed by the middle level compared to the highest (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.20-1.43).


Conclusions
Our results show that current cigarette smoking was significantly associated with lower income worldwide and across subgroups, suggesting a dose-response relationship.


Implications
This unique updated systematic review shows a consistent inverse dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and income level, present among most geographical areas and country characteristics. Public health measures should take into account this potential inequity and consider special efforts directed to disadvantaged populations.","Studies worldwide show a consistent inverse dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and income level, present among most geographical areas and country characteristics.","M  Huisman et al., 2005","BACKGROUND
The aim of the study was to determine whether education or income was more strongly related to smoking in the European Union at large, and within the individual countries of the EU, at the end of the 1990s.


METHODS
We related smoking prevalence to education and income level by analyzing cross-sectional data on a total of 48,694 men and 52,618 women aged 16 and over from 11 countries of the European Union in 1998.


RESULTS
Both education and income were related to smoking within the European Union at large. After adjustment of the other socioeconomic indicator, education remained related to smoking in the EU at large, but income only remained so among men. Educational inequalities were larger than income-related inequalities among younger and middle-aged men and women. Educational inequalities were larger than income-related inequalities among men in all individual countries, and among women in Northern Europe. For women from Southern European countries, the magnitude of education- and income-related inequalities was similar.


CONCLUSIONS
Education is a strong predictor of smoking in Europe. Interventions should aim to prevent addiction to smoking among the lower educated, by price policies, school-based programs, and smoking cessation support for young adults.",Income and education are both related to smoking in the EU,"Ariel Esteban Bardach et al., 2016","Objective
Determine the relationship between tobacco-use prevalence and smoker income level in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).


Methods
A systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SOCINDEX, and LILACS databases. Studies from LAC published from January 1989 to December 2015 were included and were analyzed by subgroups disaggregated by decade of data, country, bias risk, sex, and age group.


Results
Of 1 254 studies evaluated by full text, 29 articles were included, of which 25 were chosen for meta-analysis. All included studies were cross-sectional or surveillance, primarily from Brazil and Mexico.Low income was associated with higher prevalence of active smoking (odds ratio [OR] 1.62; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.34-1.96) than high income (reference). A dose-response effect trend was observed: middle income (OR 1.23; 95%CI 1.00-1.52) and low income (OR 1.64; 95%CI 1.17-2.30). This association was greater in men (OR 2.22; 95%CI 1.77-2.78) than in women (OR 1.6; 95%CI 1.11-2.47).


Conclusions
An inverse relationship was observed between income and tobacco-use prevalence. Further efforts are required to determine this relationship in special populations, such as adolescents and pregnant women. This research can be useful for policymakers by improving tobacco control strategies and for characterizing public health equity issues.",There is an inverse relationship between income and smoking prevalence in studies from Latin America,"Mall  Leinsalu et al., 2011","BackgroundIn developed European countries in the last phase of the smoking epidemic, education is a stronger predictor of smoking than income or employment.

By finding patterns in such types of data, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can extract useful knowledge, providing important insights into composition-property maps. A key step in glass composition design is to identify their physical-chemical properties, such as the glass transition temperature, Tg. In this paper, we investigate how different ML algorithms can be used to predict the Tg of glasses based on their chemical composition. For such, we used a dataset of 43,240 oxide glass compositions, each one with its assigned Tg. Besides, to assess the predictive performance obtained by ML algorithms, we investigated the possible gains by tuning the hyperparameters of these algorithms. The results show that the best ML algorithm for predicting Tg is the Random Forest (RF). One of the main challenges in this task is the prediction of extreme Tg values. To do this, we assessed the predictive performance of the investigated ML algorithms in three Tg intervals. For extreme Tg values ( ≤  450 K and  ≥  1150 K), the top-performing algorithm was the k-Nearest Neighbours, closely followed by RF. The induced RF model predicted extreme values of Tg with a Relative Deviation (RD) of 3.5% for glasses with high Tg ( ≥  1150 K), and RD of 7.5% for glasses with very low Tg ( ≤  450 K). Finally, we propose a new visual approach to explain what our RF model learned, highlighting the importance of each chemical element to obtain glasses with extreme Tg. This study can be easily expanded to predict other composition–property combinations and can advantageously replace empirical approaches for developing novel glasses with relevant properties and applications.","In this paper, we investigate how different ML algorithms can be used to predict the Tg of glasses based on their chemical composition.

The protein encoded by the IL-13 cDNA is the human homologue of a mouse Th2-product called P600. Here, we show that IL-13 acts at different stages of the B cell maturation pathway: (a) it enhances the expression of CD23/Fc epsilon RII and class II MHC antigens on resting B cells; (b) it stimulates B cell proliferation in combination with anti-Ig and anti-CD40 antibodies; and (c) it induces IgE synthesis.

Minty et al., 1993","The discovery of new cytokines normally relies on a prior knowledge of at least one of their biological effects, which is used as a criterion either for the purification of the protein or for the isolation of the complementary DNA by expression cloning. However, the redundancy of cytokine activities complicates the discovery of novel cytokines in this way, and the pleiotropic nature of many cytokines means that the principal activities of a new cytokine may bear little relation to that used for its isolation. We have adopted an alternative approach which relies on differential screening of an organized subtracted cDNA library from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using the inducibility of lymphokine messenger RNAs by anti-CD28 as a primary screening criterion. The ligation of the CD28 antigen on the T lymphocyte by a surface antigen, B7/BB-1, expressed on activated B lymphocytes and monocytes is a key step in the activation of T lymphocytes and the accumulation of lymphokine mRNAs. Here we report the discovery by molecular cloning of a new interleukin (interleukin-13 or IL-13) expressed in activated human T lymphocytes.

From the perspective of health care and health information provision, this is both encouraging and unsettling; the demand indicates a clear direction for the development of future resources, but it also underscores the importance of processes ensuring access, reliability, and quality control. Objective This review provides an overview of current literature on pregnancy apps and aims at describing (1) the ways in which apps are used by women, in general, and by those of a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background; (2) the utility and quality of information provided; and (3) areas where more research, development, and oversight are needed. Methods We chose a narrative review methodology for the study and performed a structured literature search including studies published between 2012 and 2017. Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Studies were identified for inclusion using two separate search criteria and strategies: (1) studies on pregnancy apps and pregnant women’s use of these apps and (2) studies on CALD pregnant women and their use of technology for accessing information on and services for pregnancy. Overall, we selected 38 studies. Results We found that pregnancy apps were principally used to access pregnancy health and fetal development information. Data storage capability, Web-based features or personalized tools, and social media features were also popular app features sought by women. Lower rates of the pregnancy app uptake were indicated among lower-income and non-English-speaking women. Preliminary evidence indicates that a combination of technological, health literacy, and language issues may result in lower uptake of pregnancy apps by these groups; however, further investigation is required. A marked limitation of the health app industry is lack of regulation in a commercially dominated field, making it difficult for users to assess the reliability of the information being presented. Health professionals and users alike indicate that given the choice, they would prefer using pregnancy apps that are relevant to their local health care context and come from a trusted source. Evidence indicates a need for greater health professional and institutional engagement in the app development, as well as awareness of and guidance for women’s use of these resources. Conclusions This is the first review of pregnancy app use, types of information provided, and features preferred by pregnant women in general and by those of a CALD background in particular. It indicates the demand for access to accurate information that is relevant to users, their community, and their associated health services. Given the popularity of pregnancy apps, such apps have enormous potential to be used for the provision of accurate, evidence-based health information.","The paper aruges that pregnancy apps help pregnant women access health and fetal development information and store data.

The weekly rate of weight gain was set above 0.6\u00a0lbs per week, which exceeded IOM guidelines for healthy GWG for an overweight woman. Apps were independently scored based on presence of features and guidelines. Initially, 296 apps were screened for review. Among these apps, 209 did not meet inclusion criteria for the review. The final review included 87 apps. Overall, 73 (84%) apps had a weight tracking feature, 19 (22%) apps provided accurate weight gain guidelines, 8 (9%) apps included calorie (kcal) recommendations, and 7 (8%) apps included exercise guidelines. Overall, there is a paucity of apps for tracking GWG that use IOM guidelines and promote evidence-based healthy weight-related behaviors during pregnancy.

Critics argue that many of the apps are inaccurate and lack evidence from either clinical trials or user experience. The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the research literature on mHealth apps that track menstruation and fertility. Methods This project followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The ACM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for material published between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2019. Data summary and synthesis were used to chart and analyse the data. Results In total 654 records were reviewed. Subsequently, 135 duplicate records and 501 records that did not meet the inclusion criteria were removed. Eighteen records from 13 countries form the basis of this review. The papers reviewed cover a variety of disciplinary and methodological frameworks. Three main themes were identified: fertility and reproductive health tracking, pregnancy planning, and pregnancy prevention. Conclusions Motivations for fertility app use are varied, overlap and change over time, although women want apps that are accurate and evidence-based regardless of whether they are tracking their fertility, planning a pregnancy or using the app as a form of contraception. There is a lack of critical debate and engagement in the development, evaluation, usage and regulation of fertility and menstruation apps.

From the perspective of health care and health information provision, this is both encouraging and unsettling; the demand indicates a clear direction for the development of future resources, but it also underscores the importance of processes ensuring access, reliability, and quality control. Objective This review provides an overview of current literature on pregnancy apps and aims at describing (1) the ways in which apps are used by women, in general, and by those of a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background; (2) the utility and quality of information provided; and (3) areas where more research, development, and oversight are needed. Methods We chose a narrative review methodology for the study and performed a structured literature search including studies published between 2012 and 2017. Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Studies were identified for inclusion using two separate search criteria and strategies: (1) studies on pregnancy apps and pregnant women\u2019s use of these apps and (2) studies on CALD pregnant women and their use of technology for accessing information on and services for pregnancy. Overall, we selected 38 studies. Results We found that pregnancy apps were principally used to access pregnancy health and fetal development information. Data storage capability, Web-based features or personalized tools, and social media features were also popular app features sought by women. Lower rates of the pregnancy app uptake were indicated among lower-income and non-English-speaking women. Preliminary evidence indicates that a combination of technological, health literacy, and language issues may result in lower uptake of pregnancy apps by these groups; however, further investigation is required. A marked limitation of the health app industry is lack of regulation in a commercially dominated field, making it difficult for users to assess the reliability of the information being presented. Health professionals and users alike indicate that given the choice, they would prefer using pregnancy apps that are relevant to their local health care context and come from a trusted source. Evidence indicates a need for greater health professional and institutional engagement in the app development, as well as awareness of and guidance for women\u2019s use of these resources. Conclusions This is the first review of pregnancy app use, types of information provided, and features preferred by pregnant women in general and by those of a CALD background in particular. It indicates the demand for access to accurate information that is relevant to users, their community, and their associated health services. Given the popularity of pregnancy apps, such apps have enormous potential to be used for the provision of accurate, evidence-based health information."", ""year"": 2018}]",What are the benefits and drawbacks of using a pregnancy tracking app?,
TRUE,test,How does bullying of students with autism compare to bullying of students without disabilities?,"Chad A. Rose et al., 2015","Abstract. Students with disabilities are disproportionately represented within the bullying dynamic. However, few studies have investigated the interaction between disability identification and special education services. The current study evaluated bullying involvement (direct victimization, relational victimization, cybervictimization, bullying, fighting, relational perpetration) among 1,055 students with specific disabilities in inclusive and restrictive settings and their demographically matched (race, gender, grade) peers without disabilities. The results suggest that students with disabilities experience higher rates of victimization and engage in more fighting than students without disabilities. However, students with learning disabilities and autism spectrum disorders tended to report higher rates of victimization in inclusive environments, whereas students with intellectual disabilities and emotional and behavioral disorders reported higher rates of victimization in restrictive settings.

METHODS
This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2011 and June 2012 and included female students from three large universities in Ajman, United Arab Emirates (UAE). A stratified random sampling procedure was used. Data were collected through a validated, pilot-tested, self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included 35 questions testing knowledge of risk factors, warning signs and methods for the early detection of breast cancer. Participants' opinions regarding breast cancer misconceptions were also sought.


RESULTS
The participants (n = 392) were most frequently between 18 and 22 years old (63.5%), non-Emirati (90.1%) and never married (89%). A family history of breast cancer was reported by 36 (9.2%) of the students. The percentage of participants who had low/below average knowledge scores regarding risk factors, warning signs and methods for early detection of breast cancer was 40.6%, 45.9% and 86.5%, respectively. Significantly higher knowledge scores on risk factors were noticed among participants with a family history of breast cancer (P = 0.03). The misconception most frequently identified was that ""treatment for breast cancer affects a woman's femininity"" (62.5%).

TRUE,test,How high HbA1c affects hernia?,"Shingo Shimada et al., 2020","Background
Currently, the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing worldwide. However, the influence of DM or hyperglycemia on the outcome of resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear.


Methods
We analyzed 756 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy. These patients were assigned to an HbA1c ≥7.0% (H-A1c; n=100) or HbA1c <7.0% (L-A1c; n=656) group depending on their HbA1c level at admission. We investigated prognoses, clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes including morbidities of HCC patients with high HbA1c, prognoses according to the treatment for DM were also investigated.


Results
Among all patients and those with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) did not differ significantly between the H-A1c and L-A1c groups. In contrast, the 5-year OS rate of the H-A1c group was 55% and that of the L-A1c group 71% among patients without HBV and HCV (NBNC patients) (P=0.03). Among NBNC patients, the median RFS of the H-A1c group was 13 months, and that of the L-A1c group was 26 months (P=0.02). In addition, metformin use was an independent favorable factor for both OS and RFS. The H-A1c group had significantly higher rates of hyperbilirubinemia, wound infection, and pneumonia.

HCC patients with high HbA1c might have poor prognoses for both survival and recurrence in NBNC-HCC. High HbA1c may also be a risk factor for morbidities after hepatectomy.

HbA(1c) is a standard clinical assessment of glycemia and the basis of most data relating glycemic control to complications. It remains unclear, however, whether HbA(1c) is affected by glycemic variation and mean glycemia.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
To test this question, we analyzed the statistical relationship between HbA(1c) levels and glycemic variability as measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). The records of 256 subjects were studied. SMBG data for the preceding 3 months were downloaded, and HbA(1c) was measured by ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. Simple- and random-effects linear regression models were used to assess the independent contributions of mean blood glucose (BG) and SD of BG to HbA(1c), after adjusting for the mean BG.


RESULTS
Mean +/- SD for HbA(1c) was 7.66 +/- 1.11% and for BG was 8.5 +/- 1.9 mmol/l (153.3 +/- 34.9 mg/dl); SD of BG for individual subjects was 3.5 mmol/l (63.3 mg/dl), varying from 0.4 mmol/l (8.1 mg/dl; very stable glycemia) to 8.4 mmol/l (152.5 mg/dl; very unstable glycemia). A close correlation between mean BG and HbA(1c) was demonstrated (r = 0.62). Also, within-subject SD of BG correlated with HbA(1c) (r = 0.375), indicating that people with poorer glycemic control had higher BG variance. After adjusting for mean BG in a linear regression model, however, the effect of the within-subject SD of BG on the HbA(1c) was insignificant. Several further analyses confirmed the strength of the observation.

HbA(1c) reflects mean glycemia and is not meaningfully affected by glycemic instability after adjusting for mean BG.",The paper is not relevant to the question.

TRUE,test,At what daily dose does vitamin d3 hit diminishing returns?,"Patrick J. McCullough et al., 2019","Vitamin D3 is a secosteroid hormone produced in the skin in amounts estimated up to 25,000 international units (IUs) a day by the action of UVB radiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol. Vitamin D deficiency is common due to both lack of adequate sun exposure to the skin, and because vitamin D is present in very few food sources. Deficiency is strongly linked to increased risk for a multitude of diseases, several of which have historically been shown to improve dramatically with either adequate UVB exposure to the skin, or to oral or topical supplementation with vitamin D. These diseases include asthma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, rickets and tuberculosis. All patients in our hospital have been routinely screened on admission for vitamin D deficiency since July 2011, and offered supplementation to either correct or prevent deficiency. During this time, we have admitted over 4700 patients, the vast majority of whom agreed to supplementation with either 5000 or 10,000 IUs/day. Due to disease concerns, a few agreed to larger amounts, ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 IUs/day. There have been no cases of vitamin D3 induced hypercalcemia or any adverse events attributable to vitamin D3 supplementation in any patient. Three patients with psoriasis showed marked clinical improvement in their skin using 20,000 to 50,000 IUs/day. Analysis of 777 recently tested patients (new and long-term) not on D3 revealed 28.7% with 25-hydroxyvitaminD3 (25OHD3) blood levels < 20 ng/ml, 64.1% < 30 ng/ml, a mean 25OHD3 level of 27.1 ng/ml, with a range from 4.9 to 74.8 ng/ml. Analysis of 418 inpatients on D3 long enough to develop 25OHD3 blood levels > 74.4 ng/ml showed a mean 25OHD3 level of 118.9 ng/ml, with a range from 74.4 to 384.8 ng/ml. The average serum calcium level in these 2 groups was 9.5 (no D3) vs 9.6 (D3), with ranges of 8.4 to 10.7 (no D3) vs 8.6 to 10.7 mg/dl (D3), after excluding patients with other causes of hypercalcemia. The average intact parathyroid hormone levels were 24.2 pg/ml (D3) vs. 30.2 pg/ml (no D3).

Methods: This open label, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial was performed during the spring and summer period enrolling adult subjects with 25OHD levels <20 ng/ml. In a sub-study presented here, subjects were randomized into two treatment groups using 30,0000 IU Vitamin D3 film coated tablets either in weekly (WD30K group, daily dose equivalent of 4286 IU/day) or a standard dose for maintenance treatment in a daily administration (SDD1K group, 1000 IU/day). Subjects in a control group received a similar 30,0000 IU Vitamin D3 film coated tablets in a once-per-month schedule (MD30K), dosing schedule for 12 weeks, (an equivalent to 1000 IU/day). The assessment of efficacy made by the changes in 25OHD and PTH levels in a throughout 12 weeks. Routine laboratory tests, serum and urinary calcium served for laboratory-safety assessments in every 4 weeks throughout the duration of the study. Results: The baseline values of 25OHD at in group (WD30K, SDD1K and MD30K) were in similar range: 13.7 ± 3.7 ng/mL, 13.48 ± 3.9 ng/mL and 13.1 ± 4.3 ng/mL, respectively. A daily dose of 1000 IU for 12 weeks was effective in restoration of 25OHD values to above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), however the median of the group failed to attain the 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) threshold. Dose-response was statistically different in the 4286 IU/day group compared to a 1000 IU/daily dose (p<0.001) for all study visits. Treatment efficiency assessed on two levels and for treatment duration of 8 and 12 weeks. The limit of 25 ng/mL was achieved by 95% of patients in 8 weeks with 30,000 IU/wk administration (vs. only 33% with 1000 IU/d) but more prominent difference observed with the limit of desired range (>30 ng/ml): 91% vs. 10% of subjects in after 8 weeks with 30,000 IU/wk and 1000 IU/d doses and 95% vs. 24% by end of the 12 weeks of treatment. The treatment-related increment potential was in a range of 2.26-2.92 ng/week for the weekly 30K dosing group compared to 1.32-1.70 ng/week for the 1000 IU/day standard maintenance dose group after 8 weeks. Treatment with 30,000 IU doses of Vitamin D3 in a weekly administration for 12 weeks did not abolish serum calcium levels. No difference in frequency of laboratory adverse events and other safety parameters was observed compared to lower maintenance doses or to control group. Conclusion: The safety of weekly loading oral doses of 30,000 IU vitamin D3 tablets was demonstrated and efficacy compared to the maintenance treatment with a daily dose equivalent of 1000 IU/d, in a daily or in monthly schedule in vitamin D deficient, adult population.

For all endpoints, levels in the deficient range (< 50 nmol/l; < 20 ng/ml) are associated with no benefit or adverse effects, while the most advantageous serum levels for 25(OH)D appeared to be close to 75 nmol/l (30 ng/ml).

Despite similar well-defined models for risk assessment, each report has failed to adapt its message to new evidence of no adverse effects at higher doses. Inappropriately low UL values, or guidance values, for vitamin D have hindered objective clinical research on vitamin D nutrition, they have hindered our understanding of its role in disease prevention, and restricted the amount of vitamin D in multivitamins and foods to doses too low to benefit public health."", ""year"": 2006}, {""title"": ""Safety and Efficacy of Weekly 30,000 IU Vitamin D Supplementation as a Slower Loading Dose Administration Compared to a Daily Maintenance Schedule in Deficient Patients: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial"", ""authors"": [""B\u00e9la E T\u00f3th"", ""I.

Methods: This open label, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial was performed during the spring and summer period enrolling adult subjects with 25OHD levels <20 ng/ml. In a sub-study presented here, subjects were randomized into two treatment groups using 30,0000 IU Vitamin D3 film coated tablets either in weekly (WD30K group, daily dose equivalent of 4286 IU/day) or a standard dose for maintenance treatment in a daily administration (SDD1K group, 1000 IU/day). Subjects in a control group received a similar 30,0000 IU Vitamin D3 film coated tablets in a once-per-month schedule (MD30K), dosing schedule for 12 weeks, (an equivalent to 1000 IU/day). The assessment of efficacy made by the changes in 25OHD and PTH levels in a throughout 12 weeks. Routine laboratory tests, serum and urinary calcium served for laboratory-safety assessments in every 4 weeks throughout the duration of the study. Results: The baseline values of 25OHD at in group (WD30K, SDD1K and MD30K) were in similar range: 13.7 \u00b1 3.7 ng/mL, 13.48 \u00b1 3.9 ng/mL and 13.1 \u00b1 4.3 ng/mL, respectively. A daily dose of 1000 IU for 12 weeks was effective in restoration of 25OHD values to above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), however the median of the group failed to attain the 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) threshold. Dose-response was statistically different in the 4286 IU/day group compared to a 1000 IU/daily dose (p<0.001) for all study visits. Treatment efficiency assessed on two levels and for treatment duration of 8 and 12 weeks. The limit of 25 ng/mL was achieved by 95% of patients in 8 weeks with 30,000 IU/wk administration (vs. only 33% with 1000 IU/d) but more prominent difference observed with the limit of desired range (>30 ng/ml): 91% vs. 10% of subjects in after 8 weeks with 30,000 IU/wk and 1000 IU/d doses and 95% vs. 24% by end of the 12 weeks of treatment. The treatment-related increment potential was in a range of 2.26-2.92 ng/week for the weekly 30K dosing group compared to 1.32-1.70 ng/week for the 1000 IU/day standard maintenance dose group after 8 weeks. Treatment with 30,000 IU doses of Vitamin D3 in a weekly administration for 12 weeks did not abolish serum calcium levels. No difference in frequency of laboratory adverse events and other safety parameters was observed compared to lower maintenance doses or to control group. Conclusion: The safety of weekly loading oral doses of 30,000 IU vitamin D3 tablets was demonstrated and efficacy compared to the maintenance treatment with a daily dose equivalent of 1000 IU/d, in a daily or in monthly schedule in vitamin D deficient, adult population.

Clinically, the intermittent fasting (IF) has been observed to reduce the risk of CVDs. However, the effect of IF on the development of atherosclerosis has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we determined the protection of IF against high-fat diet–induced atherosclerosis in pro-atherogenic low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDLR-/-) mice and the potentially involved mechanisms. The LDLR-/- mice were scheduled intermittent fasting cycles of 3-day HFD feeding ad libitum and 1 day fasting, while the mice in the control group were continuously fed HFD. The treatment was lasted for 7 weeks (∼12 cycles) or 14 weeks (∼24 cycles). Associated with the reduced total HFD intake, IF substantially reduced lesions in the en face aorta and aortic root sinus. It also increased plaque stability by increasing the smooth muscle cell (SMC)/collagen content and fibrotic cap thickness while reducing macrophage accumulation and necrotic core areas. Mechanistically, IF reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Meanwhile, HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was attenuated by IF. Interestingly, circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes but not T cells and serum c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 levels were significantly reduced by IF. Functionally, adhesion of monocytes to the aortic endothelium was decreased by IF via inhibiting VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. Taken together, our study indicates that IF reduces atherosclerosis in LDLR-/- mice by reducing monocyte chemoattraction/adhesion and ameliorating hypercholesterolemia and suggests its potential application for atherosclerosis treatment.",The study concludes IF reduces atherosclerosis in LDLR-/- mice by reducing monocyte chemoattraction/adhesion and ameliorating hypercholesterolemia and suggests its potential application for atherosclerosis treatment.,"B.

Intermittent fasting reduces serum markers of oxidative stress, while nitric oxide levels may rise. Whether this translates into persistent improvements in endothelial function is unknown. The aim of the study was to address the effects of intermittent «Ramadan-type» fasting on endothelial function, nitric oxide bioavailability, biological parameters and blood pressure. Methods: We tested this hypothesis in fourteen healthy middle-aged male subjects, using a prospective casecontrolled study design. Microvascular endothelial function of skin vessels was evaluated with a laser Doppler imager, Before-fasting, after thirty days of fasting, and one month thereafter (Post-fasting). Endothelial dependent and independent dilatations were assessed by acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside iontophoresis, respectively. The hyperemic response to heating after a specific nitric oxide-synthase inhibitor L-N-arginine-methyl-ester administration, versus a saline solution, allowed further characterization of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. Blood pressure, body mass index, metabolic parameters were determined in all subjects. Results: Blood pressure decreased, while blood glucose and LDL-cholesterol increased during fasting (all p<0.05 vs. Before-fasting). Body mass index did not change. Hyperemic skin reactions assessed by acetylcholine increased during Fasting and Post-fasting, while sodium nitroprusside-induced hyperemia and nitric oxide-related vasodilation in response to heating increased during Fasting only (all p<0.05 vs. Before-fasting). Rises in serum triglycerides and blood urea nitrogen during fasting blunted nitric oxide-related vasodilation improvement upon heating (r=-0.55 and -0.60 respectively, p<0.05).

Following the 8-week metabolic alteration period, the mice were subjected to the IF protocol in which mice were deprived of food for 24 hours, every other day, for a period of 4 weeks. The IF protocol caused significant reduction in body weight, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels, in addition to augmenting the plasma and urinary uric acid levels, irrespective of the diet. Post IF protocol, beneficial LV remodeling was observed in animals fed either diet and included reduced LV mass, thickness, and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. These results comply with the improved RAS modulation, which favored ACE2/MAS receptor axis over the renin/ACE/AT1 axis. In conclusion, the significant decrease in weight brought about as a result of the IF protocol lead to modulation of the local RAS, with the consequential benefit of LV remodeling and reduction in blood pressure, irrespective of the diet.","The paper is indirectly relevant to the question.

Associated with the reduced total HFD intake, IF substantially reduced lesions in the en face aorta and aortic root sinus. It also increased plaque stability by increasing the smooth muscle cell (SMC)/collagen content and fibrotic cap thickness while reducing macrophage accumulation and necrotic core areas. Mechanistically, IF reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Meanwhile, HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was attenuated by IF. Interestingly, circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes but not T cells and serum c-c motif chemokine ligand 2 levels were significantly reduced by IF. Functionally, adhesion of monocytes to the aortic endothelium was decreased by IF via inhibiting VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression.

Intermittent fasting reduces serum markers of oxidative stress, while nitric oxide levels may rise. Whether this translates into persistent improvements in endothelial function is unknown. The aim of the study was to address the effects of intermittent \u00abRamadan-type\u00bb fasting on endothelial function, nitric oxide bioavailability, biological parameters and blood pressure. Methods: We tested this hypothesis in fourteen healthy middle-aged male subjects, using a prospective casecontrolled study design. Microvascular endothelial function of skin vessels was evaluated with a laser Doppler imager, Before-fasting, after thirty days of fasting, and one month thereafter (Post-fasting). Endothelial dependent and independent dilatations were assessed by acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside iontophoresis, respectively. The hyperemic response to heating after a specific nitric oxide-synthase inhibitor L-N-arginine-methyl-ester administration, versus a saline solution, allowed further characterization of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. Blood pressure, body mass index, metabolic parameters were determined in all subjects. Results: Blood pressure decreased, while blood glucose and LDL-cholesterol increased during fasting (all p<0.05 vs. Before-fasting). Body mass index did not change. Hyperemic skin reactions assessed by acetylcholine increased during Fasting and Post-fasting, while sodium nitroprusside-induced hyperemia and nitric oxide-related vasodilation in response to heating increased during Fasting only (all p<0.05 vs. Before-fasting). Rises in serum triglycerides and blood urea nitrogen during fasting blunted nitric oxide-related vasodilation improvement upon heating (r=-0.55 and -0.60 respectively, p<0.05).

Previously suggested mechanisms associated with activity regulation in the nucleus accumbens have centered on dopamine receptor 1 and endocannabinoid receptor 1. However, these proteins and the associated pathways were not differentially expressed between high and low active mice. In conclusion, protein expression must be determined as part of the effort to identify involved mechanisms in regulating activity and there appears to be separate nucleus accumbens proteome signatures associated with high- and low-active mice.","This paper asserts that there have been no studies to determine differential protein expression in the nucleus accumbens, the brain site thought to be involved in activity regulation, between high and low active animals.

Activin A levels in the NAc were assessed via ELISA and immunohistochemistry (in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) following a cocaine binge paradigm. Cocaine exposure significantly increased the levels of activin A in the NAc of animals that had self-administered cocaine prior to the 14-day withdrawal compared with levels in saline controls. This was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of IBA1+ microglia in the NAc that were immunopositive for activin A. In contrast, the proportions of NeuN+ neurons and GFAP+ astrocytes that were immunopositive for activin A remained unaltered.

Smoking in the workplace is particularly concerning. Smoking-free workplaces decrease the risk of exposure of non-smoking personnel to cigarette smoke. Recent studies have mostly focused on the effect of daily or non-occupational stressors (in comparison with occupational stress) on prevalence of smoking. Occupational stress is often evaluated in workplaces for smoking cessation or control programs, but the role of non-occupational stressors is often disregarded in this respect. Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in an automobile manufacturing company. The response of automotive industry workers to parts of the validated, reliable, Farsi version of Musculoskeletal Intervention Center (MUSIC)-Norrtalje questionnaire was evaluated. A total of 3,536 factory workers participated in this study. Data were analyzed using SPSS and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The correlation of smoking with demographic factors, occupational stressors and life events was evaluated. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that even after adjusting for the confounding factors, cigarette smoking was significantly correlated with age, sex, level of education, job control and life events (P<0.05). Conclusion The results showed that of occupational and non-occupational stressors, only job control was correlated with cigarette smoking. Non-occupational stressors had greater effect on cigarette smoking. Consideration of both non-occupational and occupational stressors can enhance the success of smoking control programs.

Psychedelic serotonergic agonists such as psilocybin have recently been shown to produce sustained benefit in refractory depression, end of life anxiety and addiction when administered in hallucinogenic doses and coupled with psychotherapy. While it has been suggested that similar high dose protocols may help chronic pain conditions, there are few published clinical trials of psychedelics for pain. The use of these agents in sub-psychedelic doses for chronic pain management has received even less attention. This case series details the experiences of three individuals who have used low dose psilocybin to manage chronic neuropathic pain. While the nature and etiology of each patient's pain varies, they share a common experience, including inefficacy of current therapeutics and decreased quality of life. Through self-administration of psilocybin, these patients have achieved robust pain relief with decreased reliance on traditional analgesic medications. Despite varying preparations and uncertain potencies, the analgesic effects for all three patients occurred at doses without a psychedelic experience and with minimal cognitive or somatic adverse effects. Furthermore, the efficacy of pain relief, and in some cases the duration of the effect, were magnified when coupled with functional exercise. Additionally, in one case, repeated dosing appeared to produce increased relief, suggesting a possible long-term plasticity mediated effect. These commonalities highlight psilocybin's therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic pain that warrants further investigation.","This paper is not directly relevant to the question.

Recently, a trend has developed for long-term intermittent ‘microdosing’ (usually one-tenth of a ‘full’ active dose), with reports of long-lasting relief from anxiety and related disorders; however, there is no scientific evidence for the efficacy of therapeutic microdosing nor to show its lasting effects. The objective of this study was to test for lasting effects on anxiety in rats after microdosing with ketamine or psilocin.

A 5-min elevated plus-maze test was conducted 48 h after the final drug treatment (n=8).

Statistical analyses of drug effects used separate independent one-way analysis of variance and pair-wise comparisons using independent t-tests. Statistical effects were modest or borderline and were most consistent with a mildly anxiogenic profile, which was significant at lower doses; however, this conclusion remains tentative. The lower doses of ketamine and psilocin produced comparable effects (to one another) across each variable, as did the higher doses. This pattern of effects may suggest a common (e.g. neurotransmitter/receptor) mechanism.

TRUE,validation,Which personality disorder correlates with  surrender schema?,"M. Jovev & H. Jackson, 2004","The present study aimed to examine the specificity of schema domains in three personality disorder (PD) groups, namely borderline (BPD), obsessive-compulsive (OCPD), and avoidant PD (AvPD), and to correctly identify the three PD groups on the basis of these schemas. The sample consisted of 48 clinical participants diagnosed with PDs and assigned to 1 of 3 groups on the basis of their Axis II diagnoses (BPD: n = 13; OCPD: n = 13; AvPD: n = 22). High scores on Dependence/Incompetence, Defectiveness/ Shame and Abandonment were found for the BPD group. Such pattern appears to be most consistent with Young's theory of BPD. Consistent with the theory and empirical findings of Beck et al. (1990, 2001), OCPD was associated with elevations on the Unrelenting Standards schema domain, but not on Emotional Inhibition, which was found to be elevated for AvPD. In conclusion, the present study suggests that there are different patterns of schema domains across different PDs and that the Schema Questionnaire (SQ) is potentially useful in differentiating between these PDs.",This paper is indirectly relevant to the question. The paper discusses the specificity of schema domains in three personality disorder groups.,"Marije Keulen-de Vos et al., 2017","Purpose
A core element of Schema Therapy (ST) is ‘schema modes’ or fluctuating emotional states. ST assumes that particular personality pathology consists of specific combinations of maladaptive schema modes. There is confirmatory evidence for the modes hypothesized to be central to borderline and narcissistic personality disorder (PD) in non-forensic patients. In this study, we tested three aspects of the construct validity of schema modes in cluster-B personality disordered offenders, examining its factorial validity, and the relations among personality disorders and violence risk.

Method
Our sample consisted of 70 offenders who were diagnosed with an antisocial, borderline, or narcissistic PD. Schema modes were assessed with the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI), personality disorders with the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality-Forensic Version (SNAP-FV), and violence risk with the Historical, Clinical, and Risk management scheme (HCR-20V2).

Results
When controlling for the two other PDs, three schema mode factors distinguished antisocial PD as a disorder involving both low scores on internalizing and high scores on externalizing modes, and borderline PD as involving high scores on internalizing modes. Furthermore, the externalizing schema modes were a significant predictor for violence risk inside the hospital.

Conclusions
The hypothesized mode models were partially supported for all three PDs. The findings thus provide some support for the construct validity of schema modes in a forensic sample.",This paper is indirectly relevant to the question. It discusses 'schema modes' or fluctuating emotional states and not the surrender schema specifically.,"Lotte Bamelis et al., 2011","The aim of this study was to investigate newly formulated schema mode models for cluster-C, paranoid, histrionic and narcissistic personality disorders. In order to assess 18 hypothesized modes, the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI) was modified into the SMI-2. The SMI-2 was administered to a sample of 323 patients (with a main diagnosis on one of the PDs mentioned) and 121 nonpatients. The SMI-2 was successful in distinguishing patients and controls. Newly formulated modes proved to be appropriate for histrionic, avoidant, and dependent PD. The modification of the Overcontroller mode into the Perfectionistic and Suspicious Overcontroller mode was valuable for characterizing paranoid and obsessive-compulsive PD. The results support recent theoretical developments in Schema Therapy, and are useful for application in clinical practice.",This paper is indirectly relevant to the question. It discusses newly formulated schema models for cluster-C personality disorders.,"Hannah Kunst et al., 2020","Personality disorder (PD) pathology has been linked to early maladaptive schemas (EMSs). Because of a large heterogeneity in study populations, sample size, statistical analyses and conceptualizations in the literature, the exact relationships between PDs and EMSs are still unclear. The current study examined the relationship between borderline, dependent, avoidant and obsessive–compulsive PDs, represented dimensionally as number of traits, and 15 different EMSs as measured by the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ). A total of N = 130 inpatients took part in the study (M age = 43.6, gender = 51.5% female). Stepwise regressions indicated that borderline, dependent, avoidant and obsessive–compulsive PD traits were partly characterized by specific EMSs and EMSs grouped as domains (i.e., other‐directedness domain for dependent PD and overvigilance for obsessive–compulsive PD) and that relations with a variety of domains and EMSs were overlapping for the PD dimensions (i.e., disconnection and rejection for both borderline and avoidant PDs). This suggests that PDs are reflected by a hybrid model of EMSs, with some EMSs and domains that relate to a broader vulnerability factor for PDs, and other domains that differentially relate to the independent PDs. Findings are informative for clinicians, as various EMSs per PD may be targeted in therapy.",This paper is indirectly relevant to the question.

ST assumes that particular personality pathology consists of specific combinations of maladaptive schema modes. There is confirmatory evidence for the modes hypothesized to be central to borderline and narcissistic personality disorder (PD) in non-forensic patients. In this study, we tested three aspects of the construct validity of schema modes in cluster-B personality disordered offenders, examining its factorial validity, and the relations among personality disorders and violence risk. \n \nMethod \nOur sample consisted of 70 offenders who were diagnosed with an antisocial, borderline, or narcissistic PD. Schema modes were assessed with the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI), personality disorders with the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality-Forensic Version (SNAP-FV), and violence risk with the Historical, Clinical, and Risk management scheme (HCR-20V2). \n \nResults \nWhen controlling for the two other PDs, three schema mode factors distinguished antisocial PD as a disorder involving both low scores on internalizing and high scores on externalizing modes, and borderline PD as involving high scores on internalizing modes. Furthermore, the externalizing schema modes were a significant predictor for violence risk inside the hospital. \n \nConclusions \nThe hypothesized mode models were partially supported for all three PDs.

A total of N = 130 inpatients took part in the study (M age = 43.6, gender = 51.5% female).

TRUE,validation,What are the general principles of consumer protection in the Philippines?,"Sheetal Sahoo & A. Chatterjee, 2009","The contemporary era is marked as the era of consumers. No country can knowingly or unknowingly disregard the interest of the consumers. This can be argued on the basis of fast enactment of consumer protection laws in almost all part of the world. Apart from the consumer protection laws in developed world, we could find the accelerated rate of lawmaking for consumers in developing countries like Thailand, Sri Lanka, Korea, Mongolia, Philippines, Mauritius, China, Taiwan, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries. India is not an exception to this rule. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, is one of the examples that is to be treated as a milestone in the history of socio-economic legislation to protect the interests of the consumers in India. The main objective of the Consumer Protection Act is to ensure the better protection of consumers. Unlike existing laws which are punitive or preventive in nature, the provisions of this Act are compensatory in nature. The Act is also intended to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal to the consumers' grievances, and relief of a specific nature and award of compensation wherever appropriate to the consumer. The act has been amended in 1993 both to extend its coverage and scope and to enhance the powers of the redressal machinery.THE CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE:The Constitution of India in Articles 38, 39, 42, 43, 46 and 47 provides that the state shall strive to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people; it shall direct its policies in such a way that operation of economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment, it shall make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief; it should endeavor to build an economic organization or to make suitable legislation to ensure a decent standard of life to all the workers who constitute the bulk of the consumers; it should promote educational and economic interests of schedule castes, scheduled tribes and other weaker sections and it shall also raise the level of nutrition and standard of living and to improve public health.Article 46 of the Indian constitution provides that state shall endeavor to protect the economic interest of the weaker section of its population and also protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation which means all kinds of harassments and frauds in the market place. This also includes people should be entitled to unadulterated stuff injurious to public health and safety.This principle amply reflects the inclusion of the philosophy of the concept of consumerism in article 47 of the Indian Constitution:THE INDIAN PENAL CODE, 1860THE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT, 1930 THE SALE OF GOODS ACT, 1930THE DRUGS (CONTROL) ACT, 1950 THE INDUSTRIES (DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION) ACT, 1951 THE INDIAN STANDARDS INSTITUTIONS (CERTIFICATION MARKS) ACT, 1952 THE PREVENTION OF FOOD ADULTERATION ACT, 1954 THE MONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT, 1969 THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973PRESENT SITUATION:We all are consumers in one form or another. But in the present socio economic scenario we find that the consumer is a victim of many unfair and unethical tactics adopted in the market place. The untrained consumer is no match for the businessman marketing goods and services on an organized basis and by trained professionals. He is very often cheated in the quality, quantity and price of the goods or services. The consumer who was once the ‘king of the market’ has become the victim of it. The modern economic industrial and social developments have made the notion of ‘freedom of contract’ largely a matter of fiction and an empty slogan so far as many consumers are concerned. With globalization and development in the International Trade and Commerce there has been substantial increase of business and trade, which resulted in a variety of consumer goods and services to cater to the needs of the consumers. In recent years, there has been a greater public concern over the consumer protection issues all over the world.In the early law, the doctrine of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) was the philosophy of the law of sales. Today it has been replaced by “let the seller beware”. As a result of this change of legal philosophy, business is heavily regulated on behalf of the consuming public. Many corporations today have a department of consumer affairs. Product liability suits are already a part of tort law.FUTURE PROSPECTS: The Consumer Protection Act has aroused enormous expectation amongst the masses for redressal of their grievances. These expectations can be realised only when the redressal machinery laid down in the Act is made functional. However, the place of establishment of redressal machinery under the Act has been slow. The State Governments did not evince sufficient interest in establishing District Forums and the State Commissions. In fact, the District Forum is the fulcrum of the entire Consumer Disputes Redressal Machinery because a large number of cases are to be covered within the jurisdiction for the District forum. The appeals against the orders of the District Forum are to go to the State Commission and against the orders of the State Commission to the National Commission. The working of the State Commissions and the National Commission will remain diluted unless the District Forums are set up in all the Districts as envisaged in the Act. These delays and defaults on the part of the State Government brought to the attention of the Supreme Court in a Common Cause v. Union of India, where the Court issued directions that all States and Union Territories to constitute all the District Forums and the State Commissions within six weeks. It appears that the State Government has paid scant regard to this statutory obligation. This is the most unfortunate state of affairs, for they betrayed total lack of concern for the constitution and functioning of the District Forums and State Commissions. RECOMMENDATIONS:This paper attempts to explore and identify consumer awareness regarding consumer, responsibilities and Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It is patently obvious that consumers are not only the largest economic group but also the pivots of all the economic activities. It is also true that the very consumers are the most unaware or voiceless group in most of the countries of the world. There are plethoras of laws and other mechanism to ensure the welfare of consumers, yet they have no power to order where he can make his purchase at will. Suggestion:1.Educate consumers to develop an understanding about their responsibilities as consumers.2.Consumer should organize together to develop the strength and influence to promote and protect their own interest.3.Government should make and implement rules of punishment more harsh so that manufacturer and shopkeeper think twice before adopting fraudulent practices.4.A campaign should be set in motion to involve each and every consumer for making them more conscious and aware of their right and responsibilities.5.Government and other consumer agencies should make efforts in the direction of propaganda and publicity of district forum, state and national judiciary established for consumer protection so as to make more and more consumer aware about machinery for their greater involvement and to seek justice in case of grievances .6.Redress procedure should be made more logical, easy enough to be understood by a large number of consumers.

","S. Debnath & M. Saeedifard, 2013","The trend towards multimegawatt (multi-MW) wind turbines and the increasing interest in direct-drive variable-speed wind energy systems have made multilevel converters a promising candidate for large wind energy conversion systems. This paper presents a new hybrid modular multilevel converter for interfacing a full-scale, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based direct-drive variable-speed wind energy conversion system (WECS). The proposed hybrid converter, which is used on the grid side of the system, consists of a three-level modular multilevel converter (MMC) in series connection with three H-bridge modules. The generator-side converter is based on a conventional three-level neutral-point-clamped converter. The proposed hybrid converter, as opposed to the existing full-scale multilevel converter-based wind energy systems, provides structural modularity and a higher dc-bus voltage utilization. This paper formulates and analyzes the internal dynamics of the proposed hybrid converter including the circulating currents and the capacitor voltage ripples. The ac components of the circulating currents, if not properly reduced, increase the amplitude of the capacitor voltage ripples, rating values of the converter components, and losses. Based on the analysis, closed-loop circulating current and capacitor voltage ripple reduction techniques are developed. The reduction of capacitor voltage ripples help reduce the capacitor value. A mathematical model is also developed for the overall WECS. Performance of the overall WECS, under the proposed multilevel converter-based topology and controls, is evaluated based on time domain simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.","This paper presents a new hybrid modular multilevel converter for interfacing a full-scale, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based direct-drive variable-speed wind energy conversion system (WECS).

The objective of this paper is to review the literature regarding Withania somnifera (ashwagandha, WS) a commonly used herb in Ayurvedic medicine. Specifically, the literature was reviewed for articles pertaining to chemical properties, therapeutic benefits, and toxicity.


DESIGN
This review is in a narrative format and consists of all publications relevant to ashwagandha that were identified by the authors through a systematic search of major computerized medical databases; no statistical pooling of results or evaluation of the quality of the studies was performed due to the widely different methods employed by each study.


RESULTS

It also appears to exert a positive influence on the endocrine, cardiopulmonary, and central nervous systems. The mechanisms of action for these properties are not fully understood. Toxicity studies reveal that ashwagandha appears to be a safe compound.


CONCLUSION
Preliminary studies have found various constituents of ashwagandha exhibit a variety of therapeutic effects with little or no associated toxicity.

The epidemiological manifestations of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) differ geographically. However, there have been no prospective studies comparing the incidence of AAV between Japan and Europe over the same time period using the same case definitions.


METHODS
The incidence of AAV was determined by a population-based method in Miyazaki prefecture, Japan, and Norfolk, U.K., between 2005 and 2009. Patients with AAV were defined and classified according to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) algorithm.


RESULTS
The number of incident cases of AAV in Japan and the U.K. were 86 and 50, respectively, and the average annual incidence over the 5-year period was 22.6/million (95% CI 19.1, 26.2) and 21.8/million (95% CI 12.6, 30.9) in Japan and the U.K., respectively. The average age was higher in patients in Japan than in patients in the U.K. [mean (median), 69.7 (72) vs. 60.5 (61) years]. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) was the predominant subtype in Japan (83%), while granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) was more frequent in the U.K. (66%).

CONCLUSION

The findings indicated that the male-to-female ratio (MFR) among AP Computer Science (CS) exam participants declined from 4.87 to 2.26 between 1997 and 2020. Similarly, the MFR among top scorers (students who scored 5 out of 5) in any type of AP CS exams declined rapidly, in favor of female students, from 8.00 to 2.14 during the same period. Possible implications of these findings for educators, particularly for AP CS teachers and school counselors, were also discussed in the context of the underrepresentation of females in computing fields.","The paper reveals the findings indicated that the male-to-female ratio (MFR) among AP Computer Science (CS) exam participants declined from 4.87 to 2.26 between 1997 and 2020.

Flowers, 2008","The Advanced Placement (AP) program, sponsored by The College Board, is a multi-disciplinary program designed to provide students with the opportunity to learn exciting subjects in innovative ways and gain college credit, while in high school, for demonstrated mastery in particular fields of study. During the past fifty years, there has been an increasing number of students and schools that have participated in the AP program. For instance, in 1956, there were only 104 schools, 1,229 students, and 130 colleges and universities participating in the AP program. In 2006, approximately 16,000 schools, 1,339,282 students, and 3,638 colleges and universities participated in the AP program (The College Board, 2006a). With the increasing number of participants and educational institutions, the AP program has also grown and expanded to incorporate increasingly more diverse learning opportunities. In fact, today, the AP program has more than thirty different courses covering various subjects, including but not limited to computer science, Spanish literature, and environmental science. In light of the continued success and development of the AP program (Johnson, 2004; Paige, 2004), the benefits of participating in AP programs on educational outcomes have been examined and reported (Santoli, 2002). For example, Morgan and Ramist (1998), in their study involving 21 colleges, found that students who had placed out of an introductory course because of their AP exam scores earned higher average course grades on the second, third, fourth, and in some cases, fifth course in the college curriculum than did students who took the introductory course. In a follow-up study, based on data from approximately 11 colleges and universities, Morgan and Maneckshana (2000) discovered that students who scored higher on the AP Calculus AB exam were more likely to graduate in four years or less and earn higher overall grade point averages than did students who scored lower on the AP Calculus AB exam. In another comprehensive study exploring educational outcomes, involving nearly 4,000 students spanning approximately 30 years, Bleske-Rechek, Lubinski, and Bendow (2004) found that students who participated in AP programs were more likely than students who did not participate in AP programs to convey higher levels of satisfaction with their high school experiences and earn a master's degree or higher. Overall, Bleske-Rechek et al.'s findings indicated that AP programs positively impact students' perceptions of high school as well as their long-term educational outcomes. Summarizing the primary findings in their study, Bleske-Rechek et al. noted: ""[T]hrough self-selection or something intrinsic to the AP program itself, AP involvement is a positive predictor of educational success and satisfaction for intellectually talented youth"" (p. 219). Research and data have also indicated that racial and ethnic minority students in K-12 school settings were disproportionately represented in AP programs and scored lower on AP exams than their White peers (The College Board, 2004; 2006b; Venkateswaran, 2004). For example, Klopfenstein (2004) found that African American and Hispanic students in Texas, who were more likely to come from low-income families, were not as likely to participate in AP programs when compared to White students. Moreover, Solorzano and Ornelas (2002, 2004) conducted state-level analyses of California high schools and found that African American, Hispanic, and Chicana/Latina students were underrepresented in AP programs. Ndura, Robinson, and Ochs (2003), analyzing data from a school district located in the western part of the United States, also concluded that African American and Hispanic students were underrepresented in AP programs and that the most salient variable impacting this trend was their socioeconomic status. According to data from The College Board (2006b), during 2006, African Americans scored an average of 2 on all AP exams, which were the lowest overall average of any racial group; White students scored an average of 3 during the same time period. …","The paper claims that students who had placed out of an introductory course because of their AP exam scores earned higher average course grades on the second, third, fourth, and in some cases, a fifth course in the college curriculum than did students who took the introductory course.","The evidence indicates that there is a racial disparity among participants in AP computer science exams.

,,How does the public respond to animal rights marketing campaigns?,"Jaime E.R. Shorter, 2012","Animal abuse and neglect is an ongoing, documented problem for society. Cases of animal harm stream in and out of news reports and public discussion. With changes in technology, mass communication has become more than a convenient outlet for publicizing stories about animal harm. Not-for-profit organizations look to mass communication as a way to gain support from the public. Animal welfare organizations use mass communication to benefit their causes and reach multiple groups through their use of fundraising campaigns. Animal welfare organizations were created to address the problem of abuse and harm. But, as not-for-profit organizations, they rely heavily on donations and voluntary support from the public. In order to achieve their mission, the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), two of the most popular animal welfare organizations, rely heavily on mass communication fundraising campaigns. This research study examines four mass communication campaigns from the ASPCA and PETA. The campaigns involve the use of mass communication through print, television/video broadcasting, mail, and the Internet. I describe how each organization uses these forms of mass communication to successfully accomplish their fundraising goals.","According to the paper, animal welfare organizations use mass communication to benefit their causes and reach out to a wide range of people through fundraising campaigns, but the public is not always receptive to these efforts.","Catherine  Tiplady et al., 2013","Activists’ investigations of animal cruelty expose the public to suffering that they may otherwise be unaware of, via an increasingly broad-ranging media. This may result in ethical dilemmas and a wide range of emotions and reactions. Our hypothesis was that media broadcasts of cruelty to cattle in Indonesian abattoirs would result in an emotional response by the public that would drive their actions towards live animal export. A survey of the public in Australia was undertaken to investigate their reactions and responses to. The most common immediate reaction was feeling pity for the cattle. Women were more likely than men to feel sad or angry. Most people discussed the media coverage with others afterwards but fewer than 10 % contacted politicians or wrote to newspapers. We conclude that the public were emotionally affected by the media coverage of cruelty to cattle but that this did not translate into significant behavioral change. We recommend that future broadcasts of animal cruelty should advise the public of contact details for counseling and that mental health support contacts, and information should be included on the websites of animal advocacy groups to acknowledge the disturbing effect animal cruelty exposes can have on the public.",The paper claims that the public is emotionally affected by the media coverage of cruelty to animals but that this does not translate into significant behavioral change.,"P. Conn & J. Parker, 1998","T o paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, “all that is needed for the triumph of a misguided cause is that good people do nothing.” One such cause now seeks to end biomedical research because of the theory that animals have rights precluding their use in research. Scientists need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public and thereby threatening advances in health knowledge and care. There is little logic in emotional campaigns to end the practice of animal experimentation. A 1990 study found that although 63 percent of animal rights literature concerns the use of animals in science, such use each year involves 0.003 percent of the number of animals consumed for food. Only half as many animals undergo medical procedures in research as endure surgery ordered by pet owners for cosmetic reasons.[*][1] Faulty logic, however, may be good strategy. Leaders of the animal rights movement target biomedical research because it depends on public funding, and few people understand the process of health care research.

Roger Caras, president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, reported to a recent conference on Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research that most people just don't understand what health researchers do. Many are not old enough to remember how devastating childhood diseases used to be, for instance. Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in research settings, they are perplexed that anyone would deliberately harm an animal.

For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that comes from or is tested in animals—no meat, no fur, no medicines. Asked if she opposed immunizations, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured that they do, she replied, “Then I would have to say yes.” Asked what will happen when epidemics return, she said, “Don't worry, scientists will find some way of using computers.” Such well-meaning people just don't understand.

Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate, understandable way—in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between animal research and a grandmother's hip replacement, a father's bypass operation, a baby's vaccinations, and even a pet's shots. To those who are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.

We have heard college-educated citizens testify to public agencies that we can advance health exclusively through epidemiology, cell culture, and computer simulation. We may bemoan such a lack of scientific sophistication, but we should leap at the chance to help people understand that epidemiologists can provide clues to the causes of disease but can't develop effective treatment; that, whenever they can, researchers do use cultured cells derived from animal tissue; and that scientists depend on computers for processing data that we already possess, but can't use them to explore the unknown in the quest for new information.

Much can be done. Scientists could “adopt” middle school classes and present their own research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor and op-ed pieces, lest animal rights misinformation go unchallenged and acquire a patina of truth. Research institutions could be opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Hawking, who has made courageous statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive medical treatment, perhaps through patient groups such as the Incurably Ill for Animal Research in the United States and the Seriously Ill for Medical Research in England. If good people do nothing, there is a real possibility that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the precious embers of medical progress.

Using qualitative data derived from focus groups and interviews, we explore how Australian meat consumers interact with animal welfare activism content posted to social media, either by activist organisations or members of the participants’ networks. Results indicate that meat consumers dismiss online animal welfare activism due to a perceived lack of credibility and being associated with a vegetarian or vegan ‘agenda’. Activists also were considered by participants to be ‘ignorant’, with participants suggesting they needed to experience animal farming first hand. Online activism was described as ‘slacktivism’ by our research participants, who felt that sharing something online does not create actual change in the real world and hence is not an authentic or meaningful form of activism. While farm animal welfare is of increasing concern to Australian consumers, this research suggests that information generated by activist organisations and shared via social media is unlikely to change meat eaters’ perceptions, at least in the current form in which it is being provided.","The paper claims that Australian meat consumers dismiss online animal welfare activism due to a perceived lack of credibility and being associated with a vegetarian or vegan ""agenda.""  Online activism was described as ""slacktivism"" by research participants, who felt that sharing something online does not create actual change in the real world and hence is not an authentic or meaningful form of activism.

Scientists need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public and thereby threatening advances in health knowledge and care. There is little logic in emotional campaigns to end the practice of animal experimentation. A 1990 study found that although 63 percent of animal rights literature concerns the use of animals in science, such use each year involves 0.003 percent of the number of animals consumed for food. Only half as many animals undergo medical procedures in research as endure surgery ordered by pet owners for cosmetic reasons.[*][1] Faulty logic, however, may be good strategy. Leaders of the animal rights movement target biomedical research because it depends on public funding, and few people understand the process of health care research.\n\nRoger Caras, president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, reported to a recent conference on Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research that most people just don't understand what health researchers do. Many are not old enough to remember how devastating childhood diseases used to be, for instance. Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in research settings, they are perplexed that anyone would deliberately harm an animal.\n\nFor example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that comes from or is tested in animals\u2014no meat, no fur, no medicines. Asked if she opposed immunizations, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured that they do, she replied, \u201cThen I would have to say yes.\u201d Asked what will happen when epidemics return, she said, \u201cDon't worry, scientists will find some way of using computers.\u201d Such well-meaning people just don't understand.\n\nScientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate, understandable way\u2014in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between animal research and a grandmother's hip replacement, a father's bypass operation, a baby's vaccinations, and even a pet's shots. To those who are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.\n\nWe have heard college-educated citizens testify to public agencies that we can advance health exclusively through epidemiology, cell culture, and computer simulation. We may bemoan such a lack of scientific sophistication, but we should leap at the chance to help people understand that epidemiologists can provide clues to the causes of disease but can't develop effective treatment; that, whenever they can, researchers do use cultured cells derived from animal tissue; and that scientists depend on computers for processing data that we already possess, but can't use them to explore the unknown in the quest for new information.\n\nMuch can be done. Scientists could \u201cadopt\u201d middle school classes and present their own research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor and op-ed pieces, lest animal rights misinformation go unchallenged and acquire a patina of truth. Research institutions could be opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Hawking, who has made courageous statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive medical treatment, perhaps through patient groups such as the Incurably Ill for Animal Research in the United States and the Seriously Ill for Medical Research in England. If good people do nothing, there is a real possibility that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the precious embers of medical progress.\n\n [1]: #fn-1"", ""year"": 1998}, {""title"": ""Why would we believe them?

Diabetes is a significant risk factor for surgical complications and also increases the prevalence of comorbidities, thereby increasing surgical risk. The aim of this systematic review was to establish the relationship between long-term preoperative glycemic control as measured by HbA1c and postoperative complications.


METHODS
A systematic search was conducted to source articles published between 1980 and 2014 pertinent to the review. Full-text articles were included if they met the pre-determined criteria as determined by two reviewers. Studies reporting the impact of preoperative HbA1c levels on postoperative outcomes in all disciplines of surgery were included.


RESULTS
Twenty studies, including a total of 19,514 patients with diabetes mellitus from a range of surgical specialties, were suitable for inclusion. Preoperative glycemic control did not have a bearing on 30-day mortality. There were no significant differences in the incidence of stroke, venous thromboembolic disease, hospital readmission and ITU length of stay based on glycemic control. The majority of studies suggested no link between preoperative HbA1c levels and acute kidney injury or need for postoperative dialysis, dysrhythmia, infection not related to the surgical site and total hospital length of stay. The literature was highly variable with regards to myocardial events, surgical site infection and reoperation rates.


CONCLUSIONS
Elevated preoperative HbA1c was not definitively associated with increased postoperative morbidity or mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. The studies included in this review were relatively heterogeneous, predominantly retrospective, and often contained small patient numbers, suggesting that good quality evidence is necessary.","The paper is indirectly relevant to the question.

,,How is the dietary data of UK Biobank used?,"C.  Montague et al., 2021","The UK Biobank (UKB) has assessed diet among participants using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Studies of UKB have tended to examine the association of intake of single foods with health outcomes. We used the FFQ data to develop a diet quality score that could be used to examine the relationship of dietary patterns with markers of cardiometabolic health. We applied principal components analysis to the FFQ data for participants from the Foodscapes section of UKB (n = 52,345). The first component was transformed using Fisher-Yates normal scores, mapping it onto a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The median value was used to categorise diet as healthy or unhealthy. We examined the relationship of the diet scores with markers of cardiometabolic health (blood pressure, serum lipids, BMI) in linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors identified in a Directed Acyclic Graph: sex, age, ethnicity, educational attainment, smoking, Index of Multiple Deprivation. Of the 52,345 potential participants, 33,149 (63%) had complete dietary data. Just under half (45%) were men. The average age was 56.2 years (SD = 8.2). Most (84%) were white and almost half had a college/university degree (49.5%). The first component explained 14% of the variation in the diet data. It was characterised by high consumption of beef, any type of meat, white bread and low fibre cereals, and low intake of fresh/dried fruit, salad and cooked vegetables and was defined as an “unhealthy diet score”. Coefficients were multiplied by -1, so a positive value of the score indicated a healthy diet. A higher score, indicative of healthier diet, was associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure (β -0.81, 95% CI -1.0, -0.62; β -0.61, 95% CI -0.72, -0.05), lower BMI (β -0.67, 95% CI -0.73, -0.62) and with healthier lipid profile (lower levels of cholesterol β -0.05, 95% CI -0.06, -0.04, triglycerides β -0.05, 95% CI -0.06, -0.03, and higher HDL cholesterol β 0.01, 95% CI 0.0, 0.01). Participants with healthier diet scores (>1) were less likely to be current smokers and more likely to be physically active (>1/day vigorous activity) (both P < 0.001).

Dietary data were grouped based on the presence of nutrients as well as culinary use, processing, and plant/animal origin. For each food group, we calculated the contribution to energy intake, key macronutrients, and micronutrients. We also identified the top contributors to energy intake, free sugars and saturated fat by sex and education. Results From the 93 food groups, the top five contributors to energy intake (in descending order) were: desserts/cakes/pastries; white bread; white pasta/rice; bananas/other fruit; semi-skimmed milk. Wine, beer, and fruit juices were the top beverage contributors to overall energy intake. Biscuits, and desserts/cakes/pastries were the highest contributors to free sugars, total fat, and saturated fat intakes, but also contributed to the calcium and iron intakes. Top contributors to energy, saturated fat, and free sugars were broadly similar by sex and education category, with small differences in average nutrient intakes across the population.

We examined the relationship of the diet scores with markers of cardiometabolic health (blood pressure, serum lipids, BMI) in linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors identified in a Directed Acyclic Graph: sex, age, ethnicity, educational attainment, smoking, Index of Multiple Deprivation. Of the 52,345 potential participants, 33,149 (63%) had complete dietary data. Just under half (45%) were men. The average age was 56.2 years (SD = 8.2). Most (84%) were white and almost half had a college/university degree (49.5%). The first component explained 14% of the variation in the diet data. It was characterised by high consumption of beef, any type of meat, white bread and low fibre cereals, and low intake of fresh/dried fruit, salad and cooked vegetables and was defined as an \u201cunhealthy diet score\u201d. Coefficients were multiplied by -1, so a positive value of the score indicated a healthy diet. A higher score, indicative of healthier diet, was associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u03b2 -0.81, 95% CI -1.0, -0.62; \u03b2 -0.61, 95% CI -0.72, -0.05), lower BMI (\u03b2 -0.67, 95% CI -0.73, -0.62) and with healthier lipid profile (lower levels of cholesterol \u03b2 -0.05, 95% CI -0.06, -0.04, triglycerides \u03b2 -0.05, 95% CI -0.06, -0.03, and higher HDL cholesterol \u03b2 0.01, 95% CI 0.0, 0.01). Participants with healthier diet scores (>1) were less likely to be current smokers and more likely to be physically active (>1/day vigorous activity) (both P < 0.001). The diet score was a good approximation of dietary quality and demonstrated a positive relationship between an unhealthy diet and markers of poorer cardiometabolic health. Our findings suggest that this measure of diet quality could be used to examine dietary patterns within the UKB and explore their relationship with a range of outcomes.

We aimed to describe a comprehensive food grouping system for this questionnaire and to report dietary intakes and key sources of selected nutrients by sex and education. Methods Participants with at least one valid 24-h questionnaire were included ( n \u2009=\u2009208,200). Dietary data were grouped based on the presence of nutrients as well as culinary use, processing, and plant/animal origin. For each food group, we calculated the contribution to energy intake, key macronutrients, and micronutrients. We also identified the top contributors to energy intake, free sugars and saturated fat by sex and education. Results From the 93 food groups, the top five contributors to energy intake (in descending order) were: desserts/cakes/pastries; white bread; white pasta/rice; bananas/other fruit; semi-skimmed milk. Wine, beer, and fruit juices were the top beverage contributors to overall energy intake. Biscuits, and desserts/cakes/pastries were the highest contributors to free sugars, total fat, and saturated fat intakes, but also contributed to the calcium and iron intakes. Top contributors to energy, saturated fat, and free sugars were broadly similar by sex and education category, with small differences in average nutrient intakes across the population. Conclusion This new food classification system will support the growing interest in the associations between food groups and health outcomes and the development of food-based dietary guidelines. Food group variables will be available to all users of the UK Biobank WebQ questionnaire."", ""year"": 2021}]",How is the dietary data of UK Biobank used?,
