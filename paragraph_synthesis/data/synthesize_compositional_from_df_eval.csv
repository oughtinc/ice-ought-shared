Most of the previous developments occurred by slow, expensive trial-and-error approaches, which have produced a considerable amount of data over the past 100 years. By finding patterns in such types of data, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can extract useful knowledge, providing important insights into composition-property maps. A key step in glass composition design is to identify their physical-chemical properties, such as the glass transition temperature, Tg. In this paper, we investigate how different ML algorithms can be used to predict the Tg of glasses based on their chemical composition. For such, we used a dataset of 43,240 oxide glass compositions, each one with its assigned Tg. Besides, to assess the predictive performance obtained by ML algorithms, we investigated the possible gains by tuning the hyperparameters of these algorithms. The results show that the best ML algorithm for predicting Tg is the Random Forest (RF). One of the main challenges in this task is the prediction of extreme Tg values. To do this, we assessed the predictive performance of the investigated ML algorithms in three Tg intervals. For extreme Tg values ( ≤  450 K and  ≥  1150 K), the top-performing algorithm was the k-Nearest Neighbours, closely followed by RF. The induced RF model predicted extreme values of Tg with a Relative Deviation (RD) of 3.5% for glasses with high Tg ( ≥  1150 K), and RD of 7.5% for glasses with very low Tg ( ≤  450 K). Finally, we propose a new visual approach to explain what our RF model learned, highlighting the importance of each chemical element to obtain glasses with extreme Tg. This study can be easily expanded to predict other composition–property combinations and can advantageously replace empirical approaches for developing novel glasses with relevant properties and applications.","In this paper, we investigate how different ML algorithms can be used to predict the Tg of glasses based on their chemical composition.

It begins with an analysis of the concept of strategic partnership, based on the existing literature on the topic in international relations. Since there is no consensus as to the meaning of the term strategic partnership, the paper applies Thomas Wilkins\u2019s model or framework to explain the UAE\u2019s partnership with China. Wilkins is among the few to develop a conceptual framework or analytical model of the term. The paper then focuses on the foundation of the strategic partnership between the two countries, and goes on to analyze the prospects for the future of this partnership. The paper argues that although this partnership is strong, its future depends on two important factors. The first is UAE\u2019s alliance with the United States, and the second, China\u2019s relations with Iran. Driven as it is by economic considerations and a mutual desire for closer security and political cooperation, the partnership cannot, however, ignore these two important aspects."", ""year"": 2022}, {""title"": ""The Persian Gulf and China: The Growth and Limits of Economic Ties"", ""authors"": [""N.

synthesize_compositional_from_df,What are the general principles of consumer protection in the Philippines?,"The general principles of consumer protection in the Philippines are:

-The right to be informed about the products and services being offered;

-The right to choose from a variety of products and services;

-The right to be protected against unfair and deceptive trade practices;

-The right to be heard in case of grievances; and

-The right to seek redress in case of injuries suffered.

These principles are enshrined in the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, which has been amended to cover all kinds of services and consumer transactions. The act protects consumers from unfair trade practices, and enables consumer forums to award compensation for losses and pain caused by defective goods or services.",None of the papers say much about the Phillipines. One paper mentioned that there is an accelerated rate of lawmaking for consumers in the Philippines (1).,,,,,,"Sheetal Sahoo & A. Chatterjee, 2009","The contemporary era is marked as the era of consumers. No country can knowingly or unknowingly disregard the interest of the consumers. This can be argued on the basis of fast enactment of consumer protection laws in almost all part of the world. Apart from the consumer protection laws in developed world, we could find the accelerated rate of lawmaking for consumers in developing countries like Thailand, Sri Lanka, Korea, Mongolia, Philippines, Mauritius, China, Taiwan, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries. India is not an exception to this rule. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, is one of the examples that is to be treated as a milestone in the history of socio-economic legislation to protect the interests of the consumers in India. The main objective of the Consumer Protection Act is to ensure the better protection of consumers. Unlike existing laws which are punitive or preventive in nature, the provisions of this Act are compensatory in nature. The Act is also intended to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal to the consumers' grievances, and relief of a specific nature and award of compensation wherever appropriate to the consumer. The act has been amended in 1993 both to extend its coverage and scope and to enhance the powers of the redressal machinery.THE CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE:The Constitution of India in Articles 38, 39, 42, 43, 46 and 47 provides that the state shall strive to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people; it shall direct its policies in such a way that operation of economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment, it shall make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief; it should endeavor to build an economic organization or to make suitable legislation to ensure a decent standard of life to all the workers who constitute the bulk of the consumers; it should promote educational and economic interests of schedule castes, scheduled tribes and other weaker sections and it shall also raise the level of nutrition and standard of living and to improve public health.Article 46 of the Indian constitution provides that state shall endeavor to protect the economic interest of the weaker section of its population and also protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation which means all kinds of harassments and frauds in the market place. This also includes people should be entitled to unadulterated stuff injurious to public health and safety.This principle amply reflects the inclusion of the philosophy of the concept of consumerism in article 47 of the Indian Constitution:THE INDIAN PENAL CODE, 1860THE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT, 1930 THE SALE OF GOODS ACT, 1930THE DRUGS (CONTROL) ACT, 1950 THE INDUSTRIES (DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION) ACT, 1951 THE INDIAN STANDARDS INSTITUTIONS (CERTIFICATION MARKS) ACT, 1952 THE PREVENTION OF FOOD ADULTERATION ACT, 1954 THE MONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT, 1969 THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973PRESENT SITUATION:We all are consumers in one form or another. But in the present socio economic scenario we find that the consumer is a victim of many unfair and unethical tactics adopted in the market place. The untrained consumer is no match for the businessman marketing goods and services on an organized basis and by trained professionals. He is very often cheated in the quality, quantity and price of the goods or services. The consumer who was once the ‘king of the market’ has become the victim of it. The modern economic industrial and social developments have made the notion of ‘freedom of contract’ largely a matter of fiction and an empty slogan so far as many consumers are concerned. With globalization and development in the International Trade and Commerce there has been substantial increase of business and trade, which resulted in a variety of consumer goods and services to cater to the needs of the consumers. In recent years, there has been a greater public concern over the consumer protection issues all over the world.In the early law, the doctrine of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) was the philosophy of the law of sales. Today it has been replaced by “let the seller beware”. As a result of this change of legal philosophy, business is heavily regulated on behalf of the consuming public. Many corporations today have a department of consumer affairs. Product liability suits are already a part of tort law.FUTURE PROSPECTS: The Consumer Protection Act has aroused enormous expectation amongst the masses for redressal of their grievances. These expectations can be realised only when the redressal machinery laid down in the Act is made functional. However, the place of establishment of redressal machinery under the Act has been slow. The State Governments did not evince sufficient interest in establishing District Forums and the State Commissions. In fact, the District Forum is the fulcrum of the entire Consumer Disputes Redressal Machinery because a large number of cases are to be covered within the jurisdiction for the District forum. The appeals against the orders of the District Forum are to go to the State Commission and against the orders of the State Commission to the National Commission. The working of the State Commissions and the National Commission will remain diluted unless the District Forums are set up in all the Districts as envisaged in the Act. These delays and defaults on the part of the State Government brought to the attention of the Supreme Court in a Common Cause v. Union of India, where the Court issued directions that all States and Union Territories to constitute all the District Forums and the State Commissions within six weeks. It appears that the State Government has paid scant regard to this statutory obligation. This is the most unfortunate state of affairs, for they betrayed total lack of concern for the constitution and functioning of the District Forums and State Commissions. RECOMMENDATIONS:This paper attempts to explore and identify consumer awareness regarding consumer, responsibilities and Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It is patently obvious that consumers are not only the largest economic group but also the pivots of all the economic activities. It is also true that the very consumers are the most unaware or voiceless group in most of the countries of the world. There are plethoras of laws and other mechanism to ensure the welfare of consumers, yet they have no power to order where he can make his purchase at will. Suggestion:1.Educate consumers to develop an understanding about their responsibilities as consumers.2.Consumer should organize together to develop the strength and influence to promote and protect their own interest.3.Government should make and implement rules of punishment more harsh so that manufacturer and shopkeeper think twice before adopting fraudulent practices.4.A campaign should be set in motion to involve each and every consumer for making them more conscious and aware of their right and responsibilities.5.Government and other consumer agencies should make efforts in the direction of propaganda and publicity of district forum, state and national judiciary established for consumer protection so as to make more and more consumer aware about machinery for their greater involvement and to seek justice in case of grievances .6.Redress procedure should be made more logical, easy enough to be understood by a large number of consumers.

There have been no studies to determine differential protein expression in the nucleus accumbens, the brain site thought to be involved in activity regulation, between high and low active animals. We compared the global nucleus accumbens proteome signature from known high- and low-active mice and identified seven differentially expressed proteins. Low active mice generally over expressed proteins associated with neural stress (Stress 70 protein and V type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A), and the high-active mice over expressed proteins associated with metabolism (creatine kinase B, succinyl-CoA ligase). Previously suggested mechanisms associated with activity regulation in the nucleus accumbens have centered on dopamine receptor 1 and endocannabinoid receptor 1. However, these proteins and the associated pathways were not differentially expressed between high and low active mice.

Activin A levels in the NAc were assessed via ELISA and immunohistochemistry (in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) following a cocaine binge paradigm. Cocaine exposure significantly increased the levels of activin A in the NAc of animals that had self-administered cocaine prior to the 14-day withdrawal compared with levels in saline controls.

Another isoform identified in humans, ArpNalpha has scarcely been characterized yet. We identified mouse ArpNalpha, and showed that ArpNalpha is more similar between humans and mice than ArpNbeta. No difference was observed between ArpNalpha and beta in subcellular localization and interaction with BRM, which is an ATPase subunit of mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. However, ArpNalpha was expressed exclusively in the brain and its expression was induced during neural differentiation of P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells.

A core element of Schema Therapy (ST) is ‘schema modes’ or fluctuating emotional states. ST assumes that particular personality pathology consists of specific combinations of maladaptive schema modes. There is confirmatory evidence for the modes hypothesized to be central to borderline and narcissistic personality disorder (PD) in non-forensic patients. In this study, we tested three aspects of the construct validity of schema modes in cluster-B personality disordered offenders, examining its factorial validity, and the relations among personality disorders and violence risk.

Method
Our sample consisted of 70 offenders who were diagnosed with an antisocial, borderline, or narcissistic PD. Schema modes were assessed with the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI), personality disorders with the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality-Forensic Version (SNAP-FV), and violence risk with the Historical, Clinical, and Risk management scheme (HCR-20V2).

Results
When controlling for the two other PDs, three schema mode factors distinguished antisocial PD as a disorder involving both low scores on internalizing and high scores on externalizing modes, and borderline PD as involving high scores on internalizing modes. Furthermore, the externalizing schema modes were a significant predictor for violence risk inside the hospital.

Psychedelic serotonergic agonists such as psilocybin have recently been shown to produce sustained benefit in refractory depression, end of life anxiety and addiction when administered in hallucinogenic doses and coupled with psychotherapy. While it has been suggested that similar high dose protocols may help chronic pain conditions, there are few published clinical trials of psychedelics for pain. The use of these agents in sub-psychedelic doses for chronic pain management has received even less attention. This case series details the experiences of three individuals who have used low dose psilocybin to manage chronic neuropathic pain. While the nature and etiology of each patient's pain varies, they share a common experience, including inefficacy of current therapeutics and decreased quality of life. Through self-administration of psilocybin, these patients have achieved robust pain relief with decreased reliance on traditional analgesic medications. Despite varying preparations and uncertain potencies, the analgesic effects for all three patients occurred at doses without a psychedelic experience and with minimal cognitive or somatic adverse effects. Furthermore, the efficacy of pain relief, and in some cases the duration of the effect, were magnified when coupled with functional exercise. Additionally, in one case, repeated dosing appeared to produce increased relief, suggesting a possible long-term plasticity mediated effect. These commonalities highlight psilocybin's therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic pain that warrants further investigation.","This paper is not directly relevant to the question.

Horsley et al., 2018","Short-term moderate doses of serotonergic and dissociative hallucinogens can be useful in the treatment of anxiety. Recently, a trend has developed for long-term intermittent ‘microdosing’ (usually one-tenth of a ‘full’ active dose), with reports of long-lasting relief from anxiety and related disorders; however, there is no scientific evidence for the efficacy of therapeutic microdosing nor to show its lasting effects. The objective of this study was to test for lasting effects on anxiety in rats after microdosing with ketamine or psilocin. Over 6 days, Wistar rats (N=40) were administered ketamine (0.5 or 3 mg/kg), psilocin (0.05 or 0.075 mg/kg), or saline on three occasions. A 5-min elevated plus-maze test was conducted 48 h after the final drug treatment (n=8). Dependent variables were entries (frequency), spent time (%), and distance traveled (cm) in each zone, as well as total frequency of rears, stretch-attend postures, and head dips. Statistical analyses of drug effects used separate independent one-way analysis of variance and pair-wise comparisons using independent t-tests. Statistical effects were modest or borderline and were most consistent with a mildly anxiogenic profile, which was significant at lower doses; however, this conclusion remains tentative. The lower doses of ketamine and psilocin produced comparable effects (to one another) across each variable, as did the higher doses. This pattern of effects may suggest a common (e.g. neurotransmitter/receptor) mechanism. We conclude that microdosing with hallucinogens for therapeutic purposes might be counter-productive; however, more research is needed to confirm our findings and to establish their translational relevance to clinical ‘psychedelic’ therapy.","Statistical effects were modest or borderline and were most consistent with a mildly anxiogenic profile, which was significant at lower doses; however, this conclusion remains tentative.

Following subjective reports that microdosing enhances the experience of nature and art, in the present study we set out to study the effects of psilocybin microdosing on feelings of awe and art perception. In this preregistered combined field- and lab-based study, participants took part in a microdosing workshop after which they volunteered to self-administer a psilocybin microdose or a placebo for three consecutive weeks, while the condition was kept blind to the participants and researchers. Following a 2-week break, the condition assignment was reversed. During each block, participants visited the lab twice to measure the effects of psilocybin microdosing vs. placebo. We used standardized measures of awe, in which participants reported their experiences in response to short videos or when viewing abstract artworks from different painters. Our confirmatory analyses showed that participants felt more awe in response to videos representing funny animals and moving objects in the microdosing compared to the placebo condition. However, about two-third of our participants were breaking blind to their experimental condition. Our exploratory findings suggest that expectancy-effects may be a driving factor underlying the subjective benefits of microdosing."", ""year"": 2021}, {""title"": ""Emotions and brain function are altered up to one month after a single high dose of psilocybin"", ""authors"": [""Frederick S.

Acute psilocybin effects include reduced negative mood, increased positive mood, and reduced amygdala response to negative affective stimuli.

Twelve healthy volunteers (7F/5M) completed an open-label pilot study including assessments 1-day before, 1-week after, and 1-month after receiving a 25\u2009mg/70\u2009kg dose of psilocybin to test the hypothesis that psilocybin administration leads to enduring changes in affect and neural correlates of affect. One-week post-psilocybin, negative affect and amygdala response to facial affect stimuli were reduced, whereas positive affect and dorsal lateral prefrontal and medial orbitofrontal cortex responses to emotionally-conflicting stimuli were increased. One-month post-psilocybin, negative affective and amygdala response to facial affect stimuli returned to baseline levels while positive affect remained elevated, and trait anxiety was reduced. Finally, the number of significant resting-state functional connections across the brain increased from baseline to 1-week and 1-month post-psilocybin.

While it has been suggested that similar high dose protocols may help chronic pain conditions, there are few published clinical trials of psychedelics for pain. The use of these agents in sub-psychedelic doses for chronic pain management has received even less attention. This case series details the experiences of three individuals who have used low dose psilocybin to manage chronic neuropathic pain. While the nature and etiology of each patient's pain varies, they share a common experience, including inefficacy of current therapeutics and decreased quality of life. Through self-administration of psilocybin, these patients have achieved robust pain relief with decreased reliance on traditional analgesic medications. Despite varying preparations and uncertain potencies, the analgesic effects for all three patients occurred at doses without a psychedelic experience and with minimal cognitive or somatic adverse effects. Furthermore, the efficacy of pain relief, and in some cases the duration of the effect, were magnified when coupled with functional exercise. Additionally, in one case, repeated dosing appeared to produce increased relief, suggesting a possible long-term plasticity mediated effect. These commonalities highlight psilocybin's therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic pain that warrants further investigation."", ""year"": 2022}, {""title"": ""Psilocin and ketamine microdosing: effects of subchronic intermittent microdoses in the elevated plus-maze in male Wistar rats"", ""authors"": [""R.

Recently, a trend has developed for long-term intermittent \u2018microdosing\u2019 (usually one-tenth of a \u2018full\u2019 active dose), with reports of long-lasting relief from anxiety and related disorders; however, there is no scientific evidence for the efficacy of therapeutic microdosing nor to show its lasting effects. The objective of this study was to test for lasting effects on anxiety in rats after microdosing with ketamine or psilocin. Over 6 days, Wistar rats (N=40) were administered ketamine (0.5 or 3\u2009mg/kg), psilocin (0.05 or 0.075\u2009mg/kg), or saline on three occasions. A 5-min elevated plus-maze test was conducted 48\u2009h after the final drug treatment (n=8). Dependent variables were entries (frequency), spent time (%), and distance traveled (cm) in each zone, as well as total frequency of rears, stretch-attend postures, and head dips. Statistical analyses of drug effects used separate independent one-way analysis of variance and pair-wise comparisons using independent t-tests. Statistical effects were modest or borderline and were most consistent with a mildly anxiogenic profile, which was significant at lower doses; however, this conclusion remains tentative. The lower doses of ketamine and psilocin produced comparable effects (to one another) across each variable, as did the higher doses. This pattern of effects may suggest a common (e.g. neurotransmitter/receptor) mechanism. We conclude that microdosing with hallucinogens for therapeutic purposes might be counter-productive; however, more research is needed to confirm our findings and to establish their translational relevance to clinical \u2018psychedelic\u2019 therapy."", ""year"": 2018}]",what are the effects of long term microdosing psilocybin?,

It is particularly high among the unemployed, those with low educational achievement, and those living alone (B3; B4). Poor people spend up to 20% of their income on tobacco (B3).","Overall, the papers suggest that unemployment is associated with more smoking. Two papers indicated that tobacco use is particularly high amongst the unemployed (3, 4). Another used an index of women's emancipation, where employment is counted as higher emancipation, and found that women with a medium level of emancipation smoked more than those with a high or low level of emancipation (2).",,,,,,"Somayeh Hassani et al., 2014","Background Tobacco use is the second cause of death and first cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Smoking in the workplace is particularly concerning. Smoking-free workplaces decrease the risk of exposure of non-smoking personnel to cigarette smoke. Recent studies have mostly focused on the effect of daily or non-occupational stressors (in comparison with occupational stress) on prevalence of smoking. Occupational stress is often evaluated in workplaces for smoking cessation or control programs, but the role of non-occupational stressors is often disregarded in this respect. Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in an automobile manufacturing company. The response of automotive industry workers to parts of the validated, reliable, Farsi version of Musculoskeletal Intervention Center (MUSIC)-Norrtalje questionnaire was evaluated. A total of 3,536 factory workers participated in this study. Data were analyzed using SPSS and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The correlation of smoking with demographic factors, occupational stressors and life events was evaluated. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that even after adjusting for the confounding factors, cigarette smoking was significantly correlated with age, sex, level of education, job control and life events (P<0.05). Conclusion The results showed that of occupational and non-occupational stressors, only job control was correlated with cigarette smoking. Non-occupational stressors had greater effect on cigarette smoking. Consideration of both non-occupational and occupational stressors can enhance the success of smoking control programs. On the other hand, a combination of smoking control and stress (occupational and non-occupational) control programs can be more effective than smoking cessation interventions alone.","The paper is not directly relevant to the question.
